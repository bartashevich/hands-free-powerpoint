# Hands Free Presentations: Multimodal Interaction with PowerPoint
In this work, we explore new ways of interacting with a presentation given by someone to an audience. Making use of multimodality (speech input and output, body gestures and their fusion), the speaker can move between slides, point to the screen, highlight contents, play videos, control the volume, or ask a virtual assistant to read the contents of a slide.
